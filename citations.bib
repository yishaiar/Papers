  abstract = {
  Survey; radar for autonomous vehicles transforms from detection to imaging (range-doppler-azimuth-elevation). operate in variety of target size and scenes, large DR with multipath and resolution (affected by angle-dependent clutter). MIMO enables large FOV with angular resolution for DOA estimation, noise suppression in 4d by 4d fft and filtering and clustering.
  Cognitive radar; adaptive feedback between transmitter and reciever (based on previous observations in all 4d domains). MIMO low angular resolution due to antenna aperture is solved by super resolution. Targets are multiple detections - need of clustering the pointcloud, Ml is a good candidate.
